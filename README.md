# AJAX Programming / JavaScript

## Introduction
Welcome to the AJAX Programming in JavaScript repository! This project is a comprehensive collection of examples and practical implementations showcasing AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) techniques in JavaScript.

## About AJAX
AJAX allows web applications to send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By leveraging AJAX, developers can create more dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.

## Project Contents
