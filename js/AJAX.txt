AJAX, which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is a web development technique used for creating interactive web applications. It allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. This means that it's possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page. In our application, AJAX is used to fetch data from an XML file (cd_catalog.xml) when the 'Get CD Collection' button is clicked. The JavaScript function loadDoc() makes an XMLHttpRequest to the server and retrieves the data. The response, which is in XML format, is then processed by the myFunction() method, dynamically generating an HTML table with CD information without needing to reload the page. This leads to a more seamless user experience, as data is loaded and displayed without any perceptible delay or page refresh.
