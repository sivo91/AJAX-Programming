             - you should have a textarea (or div or paragraph element) to present final results and/or error message,
              - checks for valid input, i.e., that the input is between 0-100 and that, of course, the input are all numbers</br>
              - If all input is valid then calculate and display the student's final average according to the formula:
              final average = (.5 * hwAvg) + (.2 * midExam) + (.2 * finalExam) + (.1 * participation)</br>

           - In the box beside total earnings, you need to make sure that you first add all the values for each of the Total boxes (for item 1, item 2, item 3, item 4), then you calculate the 9% of that value and, finally, you add 250 to that result to give the total earnings of the seller!
           - It is ok to use input type="text" for the seller's name but for the item 1, 2, 3, and 4, it will be better if you use input type="number" or if you use input type="text" you will need to test if the user typed a REAL number before doing ANY type of Math operation with that value!</br>
