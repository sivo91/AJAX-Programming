  "explanation_REST_API": "REST, standing for Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, or RESTful web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the internet. RESTful APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client. A RESTful API exposes a set of public URLs, each of which exposes a resource. These resources can be manipulated using a standard set of HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Typically, a REST API returns data in JSON or XML format, which is easily parsed by different kinds of clients, including browsers and mobile devices. The use of HTTP protocols means that REST APIs are stateless, scalable, and cacheable, making them a popular choice for modern web applications."
